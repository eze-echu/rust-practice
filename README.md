# Personal Rust Practice
## # IMPORTANT # ##
This is NOT a repo for you to practice rust, this is a repo for me to
upload my smaller projects made while following the course
[Rust: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-the-complete-developers-guide)
by Stephen Grider.

You can read it, check it, and post issues to correct things I do wrong.

This is not really a guideline or an order, but more of a warning so that you don't waste
time trying to practice with this... _"code"_
